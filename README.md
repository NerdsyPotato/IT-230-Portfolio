>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
~~~
All applications in this portfolio were made to complete assignments in the IT-230 class at SNHU.
~~~
>What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
~~~
I believe I completed all coding applications to the best of my ability even when I heavily didn't understand the material.
~~~
>Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
~~~
Drop down menus were necessary in some of the coding applications I developed in order for users to be able to select from various options. I also feel like drop down menus provided ease of access for users as doing it some other way probably would've cause confusion. All of my designs were successful because they had full functionality and kept ease of access in mind.
~~~
>How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
~~~
While coding I got help from a lot of tutors and of course read all of the material provided in the course to help me along the journey. I could use these strategies or similar in the future by googling or looking up tutors and that's okay because everyone needs help sometimes. 
~~~
>Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
~~~
Sometimes there was a coding strategy that didn't make the most sense to me and when searching it up, I had found alternate solutions. So I utilized those to the best of my ability.
